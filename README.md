# World Weather Analysis

## Overview:
Take the app PlanMyTrip to the next level allowing users to find potential vacation spots based on weather by inputting minimum and maximum preferred temperatures then routing out a travel itinerary with four destinations.

### Scope of Project: 
We used google maps API to create a database of travel destinations with information including: City Name, Latitude, Longitude, Max Temperature, Humidity, Cloudiness, Wind Speed, Country, and current Weather Description. We then take this database to create a marker layer with potential places to visit displaying a Hotel Name, City, Country, and Current Weather. We then picked four locations based on the traveler's perferred temperature and created a destination layer on the map to show them their future vacation route ending where they started.
